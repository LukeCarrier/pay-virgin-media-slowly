# Pay Virgin Media one penny at a time

If, like me, you're stuck using the worst ISP on earth while you wait for the better ones to reach you, and you're tired of their constant barrage of bullshit, throw rotten tomatoes at them. Pay your bill one penny at a time, and hope that the payment processors eat it all and Virgin Media get screwed for a change.

## Context

We've been fighting them for months to return the Â£200 they overbilled us when they ballsed up moving our package to our new address. They give different reasons every time we call as to why they can't do it, or when they'll eventually get around to returning the money they stole. The regulator is fucking useless and can't even manage a phone call.
